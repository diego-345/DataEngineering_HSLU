# Week 2 — Downloads before class

[All weeks](README.md) · [Week 2 materials](../weeks/02-postgresql-and-ingestion/README.md)

Set aside approximately 20–40 minutes on your first setup; download time varies with your connection. Do this on the computer you will bring to class. You only need to install and download here; we will explain the tools and start the database together in class.

## 1. Install Docker and check that it runs

If you already have a working Docker installation, keep it and proceed to the checks below.

Otherwise, download and install Docker Desktop using the [official instructions for your operating system](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/). On a Mac, choose the installer matching Apple silicon or Intel. Follow any Windows prerequisite and restart instructions in the installer. Linux users with Docker Engine and its Compose plugin already installed can use that setup.

Start Docker Desktop/the Docker engine. Open Terminal on macOS/Linux or PowerShell on Windows and run:

```sh
docker version
docker compose version
```

**Ready when:** the first command reports both a Client and a Server, without a connection error; the second reports a Compose version. Use a current version supporting `up --wait` in class. No database needs to be running yet.

## 2. Have the course files on your computer

Use the course repository's GitHub **Code → Download ZIP** option and extract it, or use your existing Git checkout. Obtain the latest published files before following this checklist. If you already have local work, keep it; do not overwrite your changes just to update the download checklist.

Open a terminal at the repository root, then run:

```sh
cd examples/nyc-taxi
```

**Ready when:** this directory contains `compose.yaml` and `.env`. All commands below run here.

## 3. Download the two application images

```sh
docker compose --env-file .env pull postgres pgadmin
```

This downloads the packaged applications specified in `compose.yaml`. It does not start them, create database tables, or run ingestion. `--env-file .env.example` supplies example settings so Docker can read the configuration; you do not need to set up real lab passwords now. We will create your own `.env` in class.

The current image versions are:

| Application image | Version |
|---|---|
| PostgreSQL | `postgres:18.6-bookworm` |
| pgAdmin | `dpage/pgadmin4:9.17` |

Let both downloads finish. “Already exists” or “up to date” is fine: Docker can reuse an image already on your computer. The first download can take several minutes and requires local disk space; follow Docker's system requirements and resolve any low-disk warning before class.

## 4. Check that the images are present

Run these commands separately:

```sh
docker image inspect postgres:18.6-bookworm --format '{{.Id}}'
docker image inspect dpage/pgadmin4:9.17 --format '{{.Id}}'
```

**Ready when:** each command prints an identifier beginning with `sha256:`. A “No such image” error means that download has not completed. These checks do not start containers or contact PostgreSQL.

Keep Docker running until you have built the ingestion image in Step 7. Keep the downloaded images; do not run image-pruning commands before class.

## 5. Prepare local Python for Part 3, Step 1

[Part 3, Step 1](../weeks/02-postgresql-and-ingestion/part-3-python-ingestion.md) uses Python on your laptop, independently of Docker. Use Python 3.12 or 3.13. If needed, install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) before continuing. An existing suitable installation is fine.

From `examples/nyc-taxi`, create a local environment and install the one required library. The commands below select Python 3.13 explicitly. If you installed Python 3.12, replace `python3.13` with `python3.12` on macOS/Linux, or `py -3.13` with `py -3.12` on Windows.

On macOS/Linux:

```sh
python3.13 --version
python3.13 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements-inspect.txt
.venv/bin/python -c "import pyarrow; print(pyarrow.__version__)"
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
py -3.13 --version
py -3.13 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements-inspect.txt
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -c "import pyarrow; print(pyarrow.__version__)"
```

Check that the version command succeeds before creating the environment. If the command is not found, finish installing Python 3.12 or 3.13 and reopen your terminal. If `.venv` already exists with a suitable interpreter, keep it and skip the creation command.

**Ready when:** the last command prints `22.0.0`. There is no need to activate the environment; the commands use its interpreter directly. You do not need pandas, SQLAlchemy, or the ingestion Docker image for this step.

## 6. Download the taxi files and their reference document

1. Create a folder named `data` inside `examples/nyc-taxi`, using your file manager.
2. Download [January 2024 yellow taxi records](https://d37ci6vzurychx.cloudfront.net/trip-data/yellow_tripdata_2024-01.parquet), linked from the [official TLC page](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page).
3. Save or move it to `examples/nyc-taxi/data/yellow_tripdata_2024-01.parquet`. Keep the `.parquet` extension. If you already downloaded this exact file, reuse it.
4. Download [February 2024 yellow taxi records](https://d37ci6vzurychx.cloudfront.net/trip-data/yellow_tripdata_2024-02.parquet) into the same folder as `yellow_tripdata_2024-02.parquet`. The final exercise in Part 3 uses this second month. You do not need to download the full year.
5. Download the [**Yellow Trips Data Dictionary** PDF](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf), linked on the TLC webpage, and save it on your laptop (for example, in Downloads). We will use it in class to understand the dataset's columns. It is a reference document, not another dataset to ingest.

**Ready when:** both browser downloads are complete and both Parquet files are in `data/` with nonzero sizes. This checks availability; we will open the file and interpret its contents in class. Download duration depends on your connection.

The inspection script will read the January file without deleting or downloading it again. The monthly loader reuses both files when you select January and February in class. Parquet files and `.venv` are excluded from Git. You do not need to inspect records or write code before class.

## 7. Prepare the Python ingestion image

Keep Docker Desktop/the Docker engine running. From `examples/nyc-taxi`, run:

```sh
docker compose --env-file .env build ingest
```

This downloads the Python base image, installs the ingestion libraries, and copies the scripts into an image. It does not start PostgreSQL or run ingestion. The example settings let Compose read the configuration without creating your own `.env` yet.

**Ready when:** the build finishes successfully without an error. Keep the image for class; rebuild it if the example code or dependencies change. This image is needed for the Docker ingestion activity, while the local `.venv` is used for file inspection.

Keep both Parquet files in `examples/nyc-taxi/data/`; the container will read them through a read-only folder mount. You can now close Docker Desktop. Start it again at the beginning of class.

## Ready-to-attend checklist

- [ ] Docker starts and `docker version` reports a server.
- [ ] Docker Compose is available.
- [ ] I have the current example files on the laptop I will bring.
- [ ] Both image checks print an image ID.
- [ ] The local Python environment imports PyArrow and prints `22.0.0`.
- [ ] Both January and February 2024 yellow taxi files are in `examples/nyc-taxi/data/`.
- [ ] The ingestion image build completed successfully.
- [ ] I have downloaded the Yellow Trips Data Dictionary PDF explaining the dataset's columns.

If any check fails, note the command and its error and contact the instructor before class. Do not include passwords or `.env` contents.

You do not need to open pgAdmin, register a database, run SQL, or understand Docker networking before class. Those are learning activities in [Part 2](../weeks/02-postgresql-and-ingestion/part-2-postgres-and-pgadmin.md).
