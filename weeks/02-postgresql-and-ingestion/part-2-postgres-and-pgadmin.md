# Week 2 — Part 2: Start PostgreSQL and connect with pgAdmin

[Week overview](README.md) · [Previous: From Source to Query](part-1-source-to-query.md) · [Example files](../../examples/nyc-taxi/README.md)

## Goal

By the end of this part, you can connect to PostgreSQL, execute SQL, and explain where the database runs and stores its data. We will establish a working destination before writing the Python ingestion program.

Allow approximately 20–30 minutes, plus the initial image download. Work with your partner and keep a short record of your verification results.

## 1. Prepare your environment

Start Docker Desktop, or your installed Docker engine. In a terminal, check:

```sh
docker version
docker compose version
```

The first command should report both a client and a server. The second should report Compose v2. If Docker is not installed, follow the [official installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) for your operating system.

From the repository root, move into the example directory:

```sh
cd examples/nyc-taxi
```

All remaining terminal commands assume this working directory.

Copy `.env` to `.env` once. On macOS/Linux:

```sh
cp .env .env
```

In Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` in your editor and replace both example passwords with different local lab passwords. For a straightforward first setup, use letters and digits; Compose interprets some characters, including `$`, specially. Keep the database name `ny_taxi` and username `deng` for the examples below. Do not overwrite an existing `.env` when returning to the lab.

There are **two accounts**: a pgAdmin account for signing into the web interface and a PostgreSQL account for connecting to the database. Their passwords serve different purposes. Keep `.env` out of Git and screenshots.

## 2. Read the configuration before starting it

Open [compose.yaml](../../examples/nyc-taxi/compose.yaml). Identify the two services, their images, and their volumes.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    browser["Your browser<br/>localhost:8085"] -->|"Published web port"| admin["pgAdmin container<br/>Port 80"]
    subgraph network["Compose network"]
        admin -->|"Host: postgres<br/>Port: 5432"| db[("PostgreSQL container")]
    end
    db --- volume[("postgres_data<br/>Persistent database files")]
    admin --- settings[("pgadmin_data<br/>Saved pgAdmin settings")]
```

- `image` identifies the packaged software version to run.
- `environment` supplies settings from your `.env` file.
- `volumes` attach persistent storage to the containers.
- `ports` publishes pgAdmin's web interface on your own computer.
- `healthcheck` asks PostgreSQL whether it is accepting connections. It does not prove that a particular password works or that data has been loaded.
- `depends_on` with `service_healthy` delays pgAdmin startup until PostgreSQL passes that readiness check.

### Two connections, two addresses

You will use your usual web browser on your laptop—for example Firefox, Chrome, Edge, or Safari—to open pgAdmin. The browser displays the interface; the pgAdmin application runs in its Docker container.

There are two separate connections:

| Connection | Address used | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| Your laptop's browser → pgAdmin | `http://localhost:8085` | The browser contacts port `8085` on your laptop. Docker forwards that connection to port `80` in the pgAdmin container. |
| pgAdmin container → PostgreSQL container | Host `postgres`, port `5432` | pgAdmin connects across the Compose network to the database service named `postgres`. |

**`localhost` means “this network environment.”** For the browser running on your laptop, it refers to the laptop itself. Inside the pgAdmin container, it refers to that container's own network environment. The same name therefore refers to different places depending on where the connecting program runs.

The `ports` entry in our configuration makes the first connection possible. With the default settings, `127.0.0.1:8085:80` publishes the container's web port `80` on the laptop's local loopback address, port `8085`. You will open that address in step 4, after starting the services.

For the second connection, Compose provides a shared network where service names act as hostnames. `postgres` is the name we gave the database service in `compose.yaml`; it is how pgAdmin locates that container. We do not need to publish PostgreSQL's port on the laptop for this connection.

**Discuss:** If you entered `localhost` as the database host in pgAdmin, where would pgAdmin try to connect? Use the diagram to explain your answer.

## 3. Start the services

```sh
docker compose config --quiet
docker compose up -d 
docker compose ps
```

`docker compose config --quiet` checks whether the Compose configuration is valid without starting any containers. It reads `compose.yaml`, substitutes values from `.env`, and checks the resulting configuration. `--quiet` suppresses the configuration that Docker would otherwise print.

- **No output:** validation passed.
- **An error message:** something needs fixing, such as invalid YAML or a required variable missing from `.env`.

This checks configuration only. It does not verify that passwords work, ports are available, or applications will start successfully. Resolve any validation errors before running the startup command.






Do not share unreviewed logs or configuration output containing credentials.

## 4. Connect through pgAdmin

1. Open [http://localhost:8085](http://localhost:8085) in your browser. If you changed `PGADMIN_PORT`, use that port instead.
2. Sign in with the pgAdmin email and password from `.env`.
3. In the object browser, right-click **Servers**, then choose **Register → Server**.
4. On **General**, enter a display name such as `DENG local`.
5. On **Connection**, enter:

| Field | Value with the supplied defaults |
|---|---|
| Host name/address | `postgres` |
| Port | `5432` |
| Maintenance database | `ny_taxi` |
| Username | `deng` |
| Password | Your `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` |

6. Save the connection and expand **Databases → ny_taxi**. If prompted for the database password again, use `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`.

Registering a server saves a connection definition in pgAdmin. PostgreSQL and the `ny_taxi` database were already created during startup.

## 5. Execute your first SQL queries

Select `ny_taxi` and open **Tools → Query Tool**. Execute each statement separately using the Execute button:

```sql
SELECT version();
```

The result should identify PostgreSQL 18.6; the remaining platform/build text may vary.

```sql
SELECT current_database();
```

The result should be `ny_taxi`, unless you deliberately selected another database name.

These queries verify that pgAdmin can submit SQL and receive results. No taxi table exists yet.

## 6. Exercise: remove containers with and without volumes

Allow about 10 minutes. A **named volume** is a storage area managed by Docker that exists independently of a container. Our example has two:

| Volume | What it stores |
|---|---|
| `postgres_data` | PostgreSQL's database files, including your tables and rows. |
| `pgadmin_data` | pgAdmin's account and saved server connection settings. |

We will compare what happens when these storage areas are kept or deleted. Use the same example directory and Compose project throughout.

### Prepare a test row

Create one small learning table in the Query Tool. This is a separate scratch table for this activity:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS connection_check (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    note TEXT NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO connection_check (id, note)
VALUES (1, 'My database connection works')
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

SELECT * FROM connection_check;
```

Before running the SQL, open the dropdown beside **Execute script** in the Query Tool and check **Auto commit?**. This automatically confirms successful database changes. If you already ran the SQL with Auto commit disabled, execute `COMMIT;` before continuing. The query should display one row containing `My database connection works`.

### Experiment A: keep the volumes

**Predict:** Will the table and saved pgAdmin connection survive if we remove the containers but keep their storage?

In the terminal, remove the containers and start them again:

```sh
docker compose down
docker compose up -d --wait
```

Reconnect in pgAdmin, reopen the Query Tool if needed, and run:

```sql
SELECT * FROM connection_check;
```

Record whether the test row is returned and whether pgAdmin still lists your saved server connection.

**Expected result:** The table and its row are still available, and pgAdmin retains the saved connection.

**Why:** `docker compose down` removed the containers but kept both named volumes. The next startup attached those existing storage areas to new containers. PostgreSQL reopened its database files, while pgAdmin reopened its account and connection settings.

### Experiment B: delete the volumes

**This experiment deletes all database tables and saved pgAdmin settings in this Compose project.** Only do this in the disposable lab with no data you need to keep. If you have added useful data, skip this experiment until you have a separate disposable environment.

**Predict:** What will happen to the test table and saved connection if we also delete their storage?

From `examples/nyc-taxi`, run:

```sh
docker compose down -v
docker compose up -d --wait
```

`-v` is short for `--volumes`. In our configuration, it removes both named volumes as well as the containers.

1. Refresh the pgAdmin browser page and sign in using the pgAdmin credentials in `.env`. Allow a moment for the web interface to start.
2. Observe that the saved server connection is gone. Register `DENG local` again using the settings in step 4.
3. Open a new Query Tool connected to `ny_taxi` and run:

```sql
SELECT * FROM connection_check;
```

**Expected result:** PostgreSQL reports that relation `connection_check` does not exist. “Relation” here means the table: the table itself is missing, rather than simply containing no rows.

**Why:** Deleting `postgres_data` removed the old database files. Startup created fresh storage and initialised a new `ny_taxi` database using `.env`. It did not recreate the table you had created manually. Deleting `pgadmin_data` also removed pgAdmin's saved settings, which is why you had to register the server again.

Rerun the SQL under **Prepare a test row** to recreate the table before finishing.

### Compare the results

| Command before startup | Containers removed? | Named volumes removed? | What is available after startup? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `docker compose down` | Yes | No | Existing table, row, and pgAdmin settings. |
| `docker compose down -v` | Yes | Yes | Fresh database and pgAdmin setup; no test table. |

**Explain to your partner:** Why does replacing a container preserve the table in experiment A, while experiment B removes it?

A volume contains the **working data**, not a separate backup. If you accidentally delete a table, that deletion changes the database files in the volume too. A backup is a separate recoverable copy that could restore data after such a mistake.

## 7. Finish and record your checkpoint

Record the two verification query results and your observations from experiments A and B (or note if you skipped B). Explain to your partner:

- which component executed the SQL;
- why the database hostname was `postgres`;
- what the PostgreSQL volume contains;
- why restarting pgAdmin does not reload or delete trip data.

When finished, stop the environment while keeping its data:

```sh
docker compose down
```

The next part will introduce the source file and the Python program that loads it.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | What to check |
|---|---|
| Cannot connect to the Docker daemon | Start Docker Desktop/the engine and wait until `docker version` reports a server. |
| Compose reports a missing variable | Ensure `.env` exists in `examples/nyc-taxi`, contains all five required account/database settings, and is not named `.env.txt`. |
| `--wait` is not recognised | Update Docker Compose/Desktop to a current v2 release. |
| Download fails | Check your internet connection and Docker registry access; retry startup after resolving the download error. |
| Port 8085 is already allocated | Change `PGADMIN_PORT` to `8086`, rerun `docker compose up -d --wait`, and open that port in the browser. |
| pgAdmin page is unavailable | Check `docker compose ps` and pgAdmin logs. Wait briefly after first startup, then refresh. |
| Database connection refused | Use host `postgres` and port `5432`; verify PostgreSQL is healthy. `localhost` inside pgAdmin refers to the pgAdmin container. |
| Password authentication failed | Use the PostgreSQL password for the server connection, not the pgAdmin login password. Check whether the volume was initialised with an earlier password. |
| Editing `.env` did not change an account | Initialisation settings create accounts on first startup with empty storage. Editing `.env` does not change passwords already stored in PostgreSQL or pgAdmin. Use the existing credentials and the application's account-management tools. |
